GEMM with the small size of input matrices is becoming widely used in many fields like HPC and machine learning. Although many famous BLAS libraries already supported small GEMM, they cannot achieve near-optimal performance. This paper proposes an input-aware adaptive tuning framework (IAAT) for small GEMM to overcome the performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art implementations. IAAT consists of two stages: the install-time stage and the run-time stage. The experimental results show that IAAT gains better performance than other BLAS libraries on ARMv8 platform.
