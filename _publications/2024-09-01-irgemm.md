This paper proposes an input-aware tuning framework for high-performance irregular GEMM on ARMv8 and X86 CPUs. The framework comprises two stages: the install-time stage and the run-time stage. Experiments demonstrate that the IrGEMM framework can achieve significant performance improvements compared to other mainstream BLAS libraries.
