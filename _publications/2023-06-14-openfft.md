This paper proposes a 3D FFT optimization framework named OpenFFT. The framework includes a novel tiling algorithm, a cache-aware search algorithm, and a multi-thread allocation model to optimize performance. Experiments demonstrate that OpenFFT achieves competitive performance compared to FFTW and ARMPL on ARM CPUs.
